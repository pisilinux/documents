Areas to Contribute Pisi Linux
===============================

In this section, we'll briefly cover the different areas to contribute.
The Guides for Development, Packaging, Testing,
Bug Reporting Documentation and for Graphical Design and Multimedia are under constructions the Links comes later.

*********************
Development
*********************

If you want to a developer you must first look 

Software Development
--------------------

You can contribute your knowledge and labour on developing new softwares for Pisi Linux or improving already written ones.
For archiving this purpose, you should be familiar with different Pardus technologies like COMAR, PiSi, Mudur, Kaptan to understand how things work in Pardus Linux.

Packaging
---------

If you're interested in preparing PiSi packages, but don't have much experience yet, you can read the Pisi Linux Packaging Guide to get involved in the packaging process.

For contributor applications:

****
Test
****

Our project will have a test team in order to test the new releases of Pisi Linux and also test packages which will go to the stable repositories.

***************************
Bug reporting and triaging
***************************

Pisi Linux bug reports are tracked in GitHub.
You can examine bugs to determine whether or not they have enough information and feedback to be worked on and assign a priority/component/product to them as soon as possible.

To know that the very same bug exists in other distributions might help us to produce a proper solution.
If the problem is solved -or never existed- in another distribution, reaching a solution will be faster by examining the work that the particular distribution did for that software.

In order to help triaging bugs, you have to be able to find them. 
Our bug tracking system can be reached via https://github.com/pisilinux/PisiLinux/issues.
Just create an account and you'll be immediately able to report new bugs and write comments to the existing bug reports. You don't need an account for browsing current bug reports.


***********
Translation
***********

Pisi Linux is translated into 14 languages: English, Dutch, German, Russian, Spanish, Turkish, French, Hungarian, Italian, Croatian, Swedish, Ukrainian, Polish and Portuguese (Brazil).
Translation to other languages is on-going.

The goal of the localization team is to bring everything around Pisi Linux closer to local communities (countries and languages).
Usually this involves doing translations of Pisi Linux tools, websites and documentations and improving their quality.

A collaborative meeting point for Pisi Linux translators is the Transifex area you can altimes step in and help for Translate

More information and statistics can be found in Pisi Linux translation project's Website https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/PiSiLinux/

**************
Documentation
**************

You can support the documentation of the ongoing projects and different development content.
Along with the end user documents, you can also prepare *HOWTO* documents for the users/contributors that have newly joined the project.

The wiki' http://wiki.pisilinux.org/eng/index.php?title=Main_Page/ and http://wiki.pisilinux.org/tr/index.php?title=Ana_Sayfa/.
for Pisi Linux is a nice place to start helping for the documentation.

You can also enlarge the content of this developer web page https://github.com/pisilinux/documents
Currently, only people with an Pisi Linux GitHub account have write permissions to the content.

*******************************
Graphical Design and Multimedia
*******************************

If you are talented in this domain, you can help with the topics which require graphics knowledge,
such as the icon sets, font types and colour themes. Feel free to ask for help from us via e-mail lists when you need visual materials to use in your work.
